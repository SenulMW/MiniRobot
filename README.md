# MiniRobot
I coded and built a robot that follows a black line using IR sensors. I powered the wheels using servo motors and designed it so that it is compact and mobile.

## Features
- IR Sensors that detect the black line and ensure that the robot travels within it
- Servo Motors to power the wheels
- Wooden Chassis to support the wires, battery, and chip

### Languages Used
C++
